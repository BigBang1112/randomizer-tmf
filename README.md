# Randomizer TMF

**Randomizer TMF - Random Map Challenge for TMNF/TMUF** is a project (inspired from the Flink's Random Map Challenge) that ports random map picking experience to TMNF and TMUF games.

The project combines features of autosave Gbx files with executable arguments to create flawless and automatic joy of exploration.
